Overview
==========

The National Biogeographic Map is a project from the U.S. Geological Survey Core Science Systems Mission Area. Our goal is to provide a platform for analysis of questions about what species are where, how well protected they are, how vulnerable they are to stressors, and what management options will have the greatest benefit for conservation of biodiversity. The documentation here covers a range of topics from technical matters on data and software code to case studies on scientific analyses supported by the platform.

Contributing
============

This documentation is a constant work in progress. We are trying to make documentation of all the various concepts we are pursuing and the platform we are developing a baked in part of doing this work, so you should see new stuff show up here regularly. We'll work over time on better ways to highlight new and changed documentation. If you are partnering with us on this work, we encourage active participation in documentation. Please visit the `GitHub repo <https://github.com/usgs-bis/nbmdocs>`_, clone if you're already a member of our group or fork it if not, contribute via standard Sphinx methods and reStructuredText, pull request, and ask for review by someone on the team. Anyone who's already a member of `usgs-bis <https://github.com/usgs-bis>`_ can merge the pull request. We'll add more folks over time who prove themselves with contributions.

| Note: For the professional software engineers out there, we apologize in advance for fumbling about at times learning to do this stuff properly. We're mostly a bunch of pointy-headed scientists who are trying to learn just enough of proper software craftsmanship.

Online Availability
===================

The content from this Sphinx-based doc package are auto deployed from the master branch to <http://nbmdocs.readthedocs.io/>. Bear with us as we improve design and process for this and figure out where all we want this stuff to appear. We'll also be experimenting with GitHub Pages and with our own deploy process into our primary outlet for the `National Biogeographic Map <https://maps.usgs.gov/biogeography>`_.
