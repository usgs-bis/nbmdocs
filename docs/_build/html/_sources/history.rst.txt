History of the National Biogeographic Map
*****************************************

The idea for the National Biogeographic Map came about as a result of several things coming together in the US Geological Survey. The Bureau was reorganized [USGSReorgFactSheet]_ in 2010 in alignment with a science strategy that came out in 2007. One of the Mission Areas created in the reorganization was Core Science Systems (CSS) that released its own science strategy in 2013. This strategy outlined a primary goal to "Provide Research and Data to Characterize and Understand the Critical Zone" and an objective to "Increase Understanding of the Natural and Socio-Cultural Implications of Biological Diversity." The reorganization brought together several related program activities with a set of longstanding data systems and expertise in biological data analytics to help achieve the actions outlined for this objective. This group was placed within the Science Synthesis and Analysis Research Program and the Core Science Analytics, Synthesis and Library Science Center (CSASL).

An internal program review of the CSASL biogeographic science activity in 2014 recommended the establishment of a small number of flagship projects that could serve as rallying points for our somewhat disparate activities. In May 2015, a small tiger team called the BioHub Working Group from within the bigeography and biodiversity programs in CSASL wrote a short whitepaper with a number of recommendations on future activities. Among these was the idea of a National Biogeographic Map as a focus with the following stated objectives:

"(1) a dynamic biogeographic map of the nation (National Biogeographic Map), and (2) a series of data syntheses and analyses contributing towards assessments on the current status of certain elements of biodiversity"

Since that time, the National Biogeographic Map has been adopted as the flagship project called for in the program review, being written into budget language authorizing the Program over the last 3 budget cycles (2017-2019).
