# National Biogeographic Map Documentation

This repo contains a standalone Sphinx docs package for documenting the National Biogeographic Map as a whole. It provides a dynamic documentation set that is regularly changing and updating as we add new components and catch up on documentation in the development process of the National Biogeographic Map and all its related systems. We leverage Sphinx because it builds workable web pages and other forms of the documentation, lends itself well to templating so we can meet visual standards, and can be managed well with versions and incremental pull requests here in GitHub.

# Contributing

To contribute, clone the repo (if you have write permissions in the usgs-bis org) or fork the repo, create a branch, build docs, commit, and issue a pull request with review requested from someone else in the team. Anyone on the team can merge a pull request, but please do get a second set of eyes on your contributions and be judicious in what you write. The documentation here is currently being auto-built to a couple of test locations and will be auto-built to an official outlet once we get an initial version and our overall process approved.
